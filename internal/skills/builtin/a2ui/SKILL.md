# A2UI / a2tea Communication Guide

Crush supports rendering rich, interactive terminal UI components embedded directly in your markdown responses using **a2tea** (a bridge to the [A2UI](https://a2ui.org) protocol).

You can emit an A2UI surface when a compact visual genuinely helps — such as a status card, an option list, a progress readout, or a form. Most of your replies should remain prose, but when a visual structure adds value, use A2UI.

## Wire Format

Embed a single inline `<a2ui-json>{...}</a2ui-json>` block in your response. Inside, provide an A2UI v0.9 payload containing an `updateComponents` message.

### Example Payload

```json
<a2ui-json>{
  "version": "v0.9",
  "updateComponents": {
    "surfaceId": "s1",
    "components": [
      {
        "component": "Card",
        "id": "root",
        "child": "col"
      },
      {
        "component": "Column",
        "id": "col",
        "children": ["title", "body", "btn-ok"]
      },
      {
        "component": "Text",
        "id": "title",
        "variant": "h2",
        "text": "Build passed"
      },
      {
        "component": "Text",
        "id": "body",
        "text": "142 tests, 0 failures."
      },
      {
        "component": "Button",
        "id": "btn-ok",
        "child": "btn-ok-label"
      },
      {
        "component": "Text",
        "id": "btn-ok-label",
        "text": "Acknowledge"
      }
    ]
  }
}</a2ui-json>
```

## Component Architecture

A2UI components live in a flat list (adjacency list) and reference their children by `id`. The renderer resolves the tree from the root (the component that nothing else references as a child).

### Core Catalog (Fully Supported)

These components render beautifully with full styling and layout:
- `Text`: Text display. Options: `text` (string), `variant` (h1-h5, caption).
- `Card`: A rounded border container. Expects a single `child` ID.
- `Column`: Lays out children vertically. Expects a `children` array of IDs.
- `Row`: Lays out children horizontally. Expects a `children` array of IDs.
- `List`: Lays out children as a list. Expects a `children` array of IDs.
- `Divider`: A horizontal rule.
- `Button`: Focusable button. Its label comes from a single `child` ID pointing at a `Text` component (there is no `label` field). When the user presses it, you receive a new message naming the pressed button and carrying the surface's current field values — a button whose id reads as a cancel (e.g. `btn-cancel`, `dismiss`, `close`) just dismisses the form instead.

### Input Components (Editable)

These components render their current values and the user can edit them; their values (keyed by component `id`) are sent back to you when a button on the surface is pressed:
- `TextField`
- `CheckBox`
- `ChoicePicker`
- `Slider`
- `DateTimeInput`

### Media & Layout Placeholders

- `Image`, `Icon`, `Video`, `AudioPlayer`: Render as compact one-line placeholders.
- `Tabs`: Render the title bar and only the *first* tab's content.
- `Modal`: Renders only its trigger, content stays hidden.

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it compact:** A2UI surfaces should be concise summaries, controls, or dashboards. Use standard markdown fences for code or long logs.
2. **One surface per block:** Provide all components inside the `components` array of a single `updateComponents` message.
3. **Link correctly:** Ensure every ID in `child` or `children` corresponds to a component in your array. Dangling IDs will break the render.
4. **Mix with Markdown:** You can put markdown text before and after the `<a2ui-json>` block.

## Common Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

These are errors that models frequently make. Read carefully.

### Buttons do NOT have a `text` or `label` field

**NEVER put `text` or `label` on a `Button`** — the A2UI spec has **no** `text`, `label`, or `name` field on `Button` in any schema version. A button's label comes exclusively from its `child` ID pointing at a separate `Text` component. A stray `text`/`label` key is dropped at parse time and the button renders unlabeled.

**Wrong — the label will be empty:**
```json
{
  "component": "Button",
  "id": "btn",
  "text": "Submit"
}
```
The `"text"` key is silently ignored and the button renders with no visible label.

**Wrong — `label` is not a real field either:**
```json
{
  "component": "Button",
  "id": "btn",
  "label": "Submit"
}
```

**Correct — use a child Text component:**
```json
{
  "component": "Button",
  "id": "btn",
  "child": "btn-label"
},
{
  "component": "Text",
  "id": "btn-label",
  "text": "Submit"
}
```

**Complete form template — copy this shape.** Two inputs and two buttons; note how *each* button gets its own child `Text` for its label:

```json
<a2ui-json>{
  "version": "v0.9",
  "updateComponents": {
    "surfaceId": "form",
    "components": [
      {"component": "Card", "id": "root", "child": "col"},
      {"component": "Column", "id": "col", "children": ["name", "email", "actions"]},
      {"component": "TextField", "id": "name", "label": "Name"},
      {"component": "TextField", "id": "email", "label": "Email"},
      {"component": "Row", "id": "actions", "children": ["btn-send", "btn-cancel"]},
      {"component": "Button", "id": "btn-send", "child": "btn-send-label"},
      {"component": "Text", "id": "btn-send-label", "text": "Send"},
      {"component": "Button", "id": "btn-cancel", "child": "btn-cancel-label"},
      {"component": "Text", "id": "btn-cancel-label", "text": "Cancel"}
    ]
  }
}</a2ui-json>
```

### Every `child` / `children` ID must exist in the components array

**Wrong — dangling reference:**
```json
{
  "component": "Card",
  "id": "root",
  "child": "missing-id"
}
```
There is no component with `id: "missing-id"` in the array, so the card renders `[a2tea: missing component "missing-id"]`.

**Correct:** Always include a matching component for every referenced ID.

### Do not nest components inline

Components are a **flat list** (adjacency list). Do not embed component objects inside other components.

**Wrong — inline nesting:**
```json
{
  "component": "Card",
  "id": "root",
  "child": {
    "component": "Text",
    "text": "Hello"
  }
}
```
The `child` field is a **string ID**, not an object. Inline nesting will break the parser.

**Correct:** Define each component separately and link by ID:
```json
{
  "component": "Card",
  "id": "root",
  "child": "body"
},
{
  "component": "Text",
  "id": "body",
  "text": "Hello"
}
```

### Do not put code in an A2UI surface

A2UI surfaces are for compact visual structures. Use standard markdown fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``) for code snippets, command output, or logs. Do not try to render code inside a `Text` component — it will not syntax-highlight.
